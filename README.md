# JavaScript_training
I collect here my coding examples from my CodeAcademy and ExecutePrograme courses.
I mostly do it for myself, as I keep forgetting how I did that or this. I hope it will somehow start making sense and
I will achieve some kind of undestructable level when I stop forgetting elementary things.
