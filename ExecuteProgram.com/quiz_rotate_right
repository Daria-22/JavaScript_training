/*task:
Write a rotate function. It should move the last element to the beginning of the array. The function should modify the original array.

You'll need to handle the special case when an array is empty (with a length of 0.) When rotate gets an empty array, it should also return an empty array.
*/

/*I had the idea - get the length, add last element to the beginning and then cut off the end which will be equal to length, 
but I did it with Chat GPT, because I did not really understand how */


//name the function, provide the parameter - array
function rotate(arr) 
{
    //get the length of the array
    const length = arr.length;

    // If the array is empty, return an empty array
    if (length === 0) 
   {
        return arr;
    }
    // get the last element in the array, its index will be -1 as indexation start with 0
    const lastElement = arr[length - 1];

    // Move elements from the end to the beginning
    // we start with the element whose index is length -1, then if it is not less or equal to 0, we subtract 
    ///from the index 1 and move to the next element which will be index -1 each time
    // the iteration stops when the index is 0
    for (let i = length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
    }

    // During this iteration, we add LastElement to the start of the array
    ///Add the last element to the beginning
    arr[0] = lastElement;

   //when iteration is over, we remove the remaining elements

    // Remove the remaining elements
    arr.splice(length);
    // Alternatively, you can use arr.length = length; to remove the remaining elements

    // If you want to return the modified array 
    return arr;
}
