['a', 'bc', 'def'].every(string => string.length > 0);
RESULT:
true

[9, 10, 11].every(n => n >= 10);
RESULT:
false

.every always returns true for an empty array. One way to remember this is that .every's behavior for empty arrays is the opposite of .some's behavior.

[].every(f) is true, no matter what f is.
[].some(f) is false, no matter what f is.
