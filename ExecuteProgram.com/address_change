const address = {street: '12 Maple St'};
const oldRecord = [address];
const newRecord = oldRecord.slice();
newRecord[0] = {street: '14 Oak St'};
[oldRecord[0].street, newRecord[0].street];
//RESULT: ['12 Maple St', '14 Oak St']
//we can't change the const
//but we can access the address by assigning an object to object in array??
