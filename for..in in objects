// Write your code below
//what I did here? 
//1. used for ...loop for interating through the inner object crew in outer object spaceship 
//2. declared a variable for iteraton for spaceship(outer object).crew(inner object) 
//2. then logged this variable (crewMember) and the attributes for this variable - which I reached with dot abd bracket notation - not really clear here

//tip:
//for (let variableName in outerObject.innerObject) {
//  console.log(`${variableName}: ${outerObject.innerObject[variableName].propertyName}`)
//};
